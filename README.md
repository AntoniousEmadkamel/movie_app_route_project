# Movie App Route Project

## Overview

**Movie App Route Project** is a full-featured movie browsing application built with **Flutter**. The app leverages clean architecture and the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern to ensure scalable, maintainable, and testable code. It integrates with Firebase for backend services and interacts with The Movie Database (TMDb) API to provide users with real-time movie data, including popular, top-rated, and upcoming releases.

This documentation gives a comprehensive and professional overview of the entire project, including its main features, technical stack, architectural decisions, and implementation details. The aim is to showcase the depth and quality of engineering skills, making this project a strong portfolio addition.

## Architecture

### Clean Architecture & MVVM

- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: 
  - **Models**: Represent movie, category, and user data.
  - **Views**: Flutter screens/widgets that display data.
  - **ViewModels**: Handle business logic, data-fetching, and state management.

- **Clean Architecture Principles**:
  - **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer (UI, domain, data, repository) is decoupled for scalability.
  - **Dependency Injection**: (If used) allows flexible swapping of implementations for testing/mocking.
  - **Testability**: Logic is abstracted away from UI, making unit and widget testing straightforward.

**Folder Structure Example:**
```
lib/
  api/                  # API managers and network logic
  database_utils/       # Firebase Firestore helpers
  models/               # Data models for Movie, Category, etc.
  layout/               # Main app layout and navigation
  shared/styles/        # Theme and color definitions
  ui/screens/           # App screens and UI components (Home, Browse, Search, Movie Details, Watchlist)
```

## Core Modules

### 1. Main Application (`main.dart`)

- Initializes Flutter bindings and Firebase.
- Sets up routing and injects custom theme.
- Defines available routes:
  - Home
  - Movie Details
  - Category Results

### 2. Home Layout (`layout/home_layout.dart`)

- Bottom navigation bar with 4 main tabs:
  - **Home**: Featured movies, trending, recommendations
  - **Search**: Search input and results
  - **Browse**: Browse by categories/genres
  - **Watchlist**: User's saved movies

### 3. API Manager (`api/api_manager.dart`)

- Handles all interactions with TMDb API.
- Methods for:
  - Fetching popular, top-rated, upcoming movies
  - Fetching genres/categories
  - Fetching movies by category
  - Fetching movie details and similar/recommended movies

### 4. Models (`models/`)

- **Movie Model**: Complete mapping of movie data, including genres, ratings, production info, etc.
- **Category Model**: Genres and categories for filtering.

---

## UI/UX Design

- **Modern dark theme** with gold and blue-black accents.
- **Carousel sliders** for immersive movie browsing.
- **Responsive layouts** for both Android and iOS.
- **Visual feedback** for loading/error states.
- **Intuitive navigation** with bottom nav bar and smooth transitions.

---

## API Integration

- **TMDb API** (requires API key):  
  - Get popular, top-rated, upcoming, and genre-specific movies.
  - Fetch movie details, images, ratings, and similar movies.
- **Networking**: All requests handled asynchronously, with loading/error handling in the UI.

---

## Firebase Integration
